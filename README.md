## Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to:

- Identify critical smart contract vulnerabilities
- Exploit insecure implementations
- Apply secure fixes
- Validate security using automated tests

---

## Covered Vulnerabilities

---

### 1. Reentrancy Attack

#### Issue:

- External call before state update allows attacker to re-enter contract.

#### Impact:

-Funds can be drained.

#### Fix:

- Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Use ReentrancyGuard

#### Cases:

1. Vulnerable case (attack works)
   ![Reentrancy Basic Test](.\assets\screenshots/reentrancy-basic.png)
2. Fixed case (attack fails)
   ![Reentrancy Fixed Test](.\assets\screenshots/reentrancy-fixed.png)

---

### 2. Access Control Vulnerability

#### Issue:

- Functions lack proper authorization checks.

#### Impact:

- Unauthorized users can take ownership or execute privileged actions.

#### Fix:

- Implement onlyOwner
- Use role-based access control

#### Cases:

1. Vulnerable case (attack works)
![Access Control Basic Test](.\assets\screenshots/partial-tests.png)
2. Fixed case (attack fails)
![Access Control Fixed Test](.\assets\screenshots/core-tests.png)
---

### 3. Integer Overflow

#### Issue:

- Unchecked arithmetic leads to overflow.

#### Impact:

- Incorrect balances or broken logic.

#### Fix:

- Use Solidity ≥0.8 (built-in checks)
- Avoid unchecked unless necessary

#### Cases:

1. Vulnerable case (attack works)
![Integer Overflow Basic Test](.\assets\screenshots/almost-full-tests.png)
2. Fixed case (attack fails)
![Integer Overflow Fixed Test](.\assets\screenshots/core-tests.png)
---

## Testing Strategy

Each vulnerability includes:

- Exploit test (proves vulnerability exists)
- Fix test (proves vulnerability is mitigated)

Run all tests:

npx hardhat test

---

## Setup

npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test

---

## Audit Checklist

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing exploit simulations
- Secure Solidity development
- Hardhat testing framework
- Vulnerability reproduction & mitigation

---

## Acknowledgement

This project was developed by @bizzorotical-ank01 as part of a focused journey into smart contract security and auditing.

It is designed for educational and practical purposes, simulating real-world DeFi vulnerabilities to help developers understand:

- How security flaws occur in smart contracts
- How attackers exploit these vulnerabilities
- How to implement secure and robust fixes

This repository serves as a hands-on learning resource for developers aiming to improve their skills in smart contract security and auditing.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository.
