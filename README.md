## Simulation Attacks

![Simulation Attack Demo](assets\demo\Attacks-Simulation.mp4)



---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how real-world smart contract vulnerabilities occur, how attackers exploit them, and how to properly fix them.

It includes:
- Vulnerable contracts
- Exploit (attacker) contracts
- Secure implementations
- Automated tests
- Interactive Web3 dashboard

---

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to:

- Identify critical smart contract vulnerabilities
- Exploit insecure implementations
- Apply secure fixes
- Validate security using automated tests

---

## Covered Vulnerabilities

---

### 1. Reentrancy Attack

#### Issue:

- External call before state update allows attacker to re-enter contract.

#### Impact:

-Funds can be drained.

#### Fix:

- Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Use ReentrancyGuard

#### Attack Demo:

##### Steps
1. Contract is funded with 5 ETH
2. Attacker contract exploits reentrancy
3. Funds are drained completely

##### Result
Before Attack: 5 ETH  
After Attack: 0 ETH

##### Vulnerability
The contract sends ETH before updating balance, allowing repeated withdrawals.

#### Cases:

1. Vulnerable case (attack works)

2. Fixed case (attack fails)

### 2. Access Control Vulnerability

#### Issue:

- Functions lack proper authorization checks.

#### Impact:

- Unauthorized users can take ownership or execute privileged actions.

#### Fix:

- Implement onlyOwner
- Use role-based access control

#### Cases:

1. Vulnerable case (attack works)
![Access Control Basic Test](assets/screenshots/partial-tests.png)
2. Fixed case (attack fails)
![Access Control Fixed Test](assets/screenshots/core-tests.png)

#### Frontend Show:

![Access Control Attack Demo Confirmed](assets/screenshots/AccessControl-Attack-Confirmed.png)

---

### 3. Integer Overflow

#### Issue:

- Unchecked arithmetic leads to overflow.

#### Impact:

- Incorrect balances or broken logic.

#### Fix:

- Use Solidity ≥0.8 (built-in checks)
- Avoid unchecked unless necessary

#### Cases:

1. Vulnerable case (attack works)
![Integer Overflow Basic Test](assets/screenshots/almost-full-tests.png)
2. Fixed case (attack fails)

## Testing Strategy

Each vulnerability includes:

- Exploit test (proves vulnerability exists)
- Fix test (proves vulnerability is mitigated)

Run all tests:

npx hardhat test

---

## Setup

npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test

---

## Audit Checklist

### Located in:

checklist/audit-checklist.md

### Includes:

- Access control review
- Reentrancy checks
- Arithmetic safety
- Gas optimization hints
- Storage layout validation

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Smart contract security analysis
- Writing exploit simulations
- Secure Solidity development
- Hardhat testing framework
- Vulnerability reproduction & mitigation

---

## How to Run if you want frontend

### 1. Start local node:
npx hardhat node

### 2. Deploy contracts:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

### 3. Start frontend:
cd frontend
npm start

## Acknowledgement

This project was developed by @bizzorotical-ank01 as part of a focused journey into smart contract security and auditing through practical, real-world simulations..

This project is designed as a hands-on security lab for developers who want to:

- Think like an attacker
- Build like a defender
- Audit like a professional

This is now:

- ✅ Portfolio-ready  
- ✅ Recruiter-friendly  
- ✅ Clean & professional  
- ✅ “Production Web3 project” level  

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository.

If you have any questions or suggestions, Let's Connect, Till then GOOD LUCK BUDDY!
